    <h2 class="tshado">
        PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING
    </h2>
    <P>
        Presidential initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-for profit
        educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help
        promote education, research and business opportunities in emergig tech fields like
    <ul>
        <li class="clbl">Cloud Native Computing</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
        <li>Internet Of Things</li>
    </ul>
    </P>
    <h2><span class="fl">C</span>loud Native Computing:</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like,
        <b><i>Linux,</i></b>
        <b><i>Docker,</i></b>
        <b><i>Kubernetes,</i></b>
        <b><i>JavaScript,</i></b>
        <b><i>Node.js,</i></b>
        <b><i>React and React Native</i></b>
        while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud
        platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h2><span class="fl">A</span>rtificial Intelligence:</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>artificial intelligence</b>
        program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
        technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like
        <b><i>Python,</i></b>
        <b><i>Numpy,</i></b>
        <b><i>Pandas,</i></b>
        <b><i>Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</i></b>
        and teaching deploying practical AI solotions and use cass,
        and ending with real-life examples of modren day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <h2><span class="fl">B</span>lockchain:</h2>
    <p>
        The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b>
        program is to understand the blockchain like <b><i>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b>
        and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also
        introduces them to development if Distributed Apps
        (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service
        (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) if a cryoti-token.
    </p>
    <h2><span class="fl">I</span>nternet of Things:</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>Internet of things</b>
        program introduces the students to open
        <source> development
        technologies like <b><i>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and
                Kubernetes</i></b>
        while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device
        control.
